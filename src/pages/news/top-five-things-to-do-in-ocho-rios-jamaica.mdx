_Ah, Ocho Rios! This charming Caribbean town in Jamaica is a famous tourist destination for a handful of good reasons. Situated on the island's north coast, Ocho Rios (translated as Eight Rivers) is known for its lovely waterfalls, natural pools and rivers, and thrilling adventures._

> If you fancy yourself a thrill-seeker at heart, read this list of the five most exciting things to do in Ocho Rios, Jamaica:

## No.1 Visit Dunn’s River Falls

</div>

Dunn’s River Falls is a must-see for any Jamaica's Ocho Rios visitor. It is a stunning 600-foot waterfall that flows into the Caribbean Sea.

This one-of-its-kind waterfall is phenomenal because of the deposits of calcium carbonate that form around the rocks and the waters that fall empty into the Little Dunn’s River Beach. This unique feature made it one of Jamaica's national treasures and protected it as a national park by the Jamaican government.

Here, you can either climb the falls or simply swim in the pool at the bottom. Alternatively, if you’re more adventurous, you can try Chukka Caribbean Dunn’s River attraction, the Falls Flyer–a series of seven zip lines and four swinging bridges over the waterfall!

## No.2 Take a Dip into the Sparkling Waters

The northern coast of Jamaica is home to the island’s only bioluminescent waters–Luminous Lagoon.

Luminous Lagoon is a hidden paradise where you can have a luminous swim if you take a boat over the lagoon's waters while the sun is setting. The lagoon is filled with microscopic organisms that light up when disturbed, making it an incredible experience to swim in.

## No.3 Learn how Appleton rum is made at Joy Spence Appleton Estate Rum Experience
