          Top 5 Things to Do in Ocho Rios, Jamaica
        </h2>

        <p class="my-4 text-gray-600">
          Ah, Ocho Rios! This charming Caribbean town in Jamaica is a famous tourist destination for
          a handful of good reasons. Situated on the island's north coast, Ocho Rios (translated as
          Eight Rivers) is known for its lovely waterfalls, natural pools and rivers, and thrilling
          adventures.

        If you fancy yourself a thrill-seeker at heart, read this <span class="italic">
          list of the five most exciting things to do in Ocho Rios, Jamaica:
        </span>
      </p>

      <h2 class="mt-8 mb-4 font-serif text-3xl lg:text-4xl">No.1 Visit Dunn's River Falls</h2>

      <div class="aspect-h-9 aspect-w-16">
        <div class="bg-secondary-100"></div>
      </div>

      <p class="my-4 text-gray-600">
        Dunn's River Falls is a must-see for any Jamaica's Ocho Rios visitor. It is a stunning
        600-foot waterfall that flows into the Caribbean Sea.
      </p>

      <p class="my-4 text-gray-600">
        This one-of-its-kind waterfall is phenomenal because of the deposits of calcium carbonate
        that form around the rocks and the waters that fall empty into the Little Dunn's River
        Beach. This unique feature made it one of Jamaica's national treasures and protected it as a
        national park by the Jamaican government.
      </p>

      <p class="my-4 text-gray-600">
        Here, you can either climb the falls or simply swim in the pool at the bottom.
        Alternatively, if you're more adventurous, you can try Chukka Caribbean Dunn's River
        attraction, the Falls Flyer-a series of seven zip lines and four swinging bridges over the
        waterfall!
      </p>

        The northern coast of Jamaica is home to the island's only bioluminescent waters-Luminous
        Lagoon.
      </p>

      <p class="my-4 text-gray-600">
        Luminous Lagoon is a hidden paradise where you can have a luminous swim if you take a boat
        over the lagoon's waters while the sun is setting. The lagoon is filled with microscopic
        organisms that light up when disturbed, making it an incredible experience to swim in.
